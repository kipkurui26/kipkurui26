## Profile Structure

To help you navigate my work, Iâ€™ve organized my repositories into four categories:

1. **Playground-\<name\>**   
   Experimental code, learning-phase snippets, prototypes, and unstructured projects. Perfect for exploring ideas in progress.

2. **Project-\<name\>**  
   Fully completed, production-grade projects. Feel free to fork (highly recommended) and adapt these solutions as you like.

3. **Client-\<name\>**  
   Delivered client work. For confidentiality, the source code isnâ€™t includedâ€”each repo contains a README that explains the solution and outcomes.

4. **Launchpad-\<name\>**  
   Turnkey SaaS modules and readyâ€‘made solutions you can integrate immediately into your business. Each repo includes:
   - Detailed README with setup and architecture overview
   - Realâ€‘world case studies demonstrating integration and ROI
   - API documentation and example calls
   
   If one of these solutions fits your needs or youâ€™d like a live demo, please send a request or reach out via email/WhatsApp.
